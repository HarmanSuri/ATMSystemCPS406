# ATMSystemCPS406
The scope of this project is to develop software for a national bank’s Automated Teller Machine (ATM)  that connects to the bank’s main system. The ATM will allow users to check, withdraw, and deposit funds without having to talk to a teller. Users will be able to perform these tasks using a debit or credit card linked to their bank account. To authenticate users, the ATM will be equipped with chip readers and users will need to enter a personal identification number (PIN). The machine will be able to update and view the user’s account information in real-time, making banking more convenient and accessible. ATM and the ATM’s specs will be provided by the bank. 
## How to use
Run AtmUI/MainFrame.java to start application.
The default PIN for the current user is 1111. Upon entering a successful PIN the user can access their accounts.<br>
Clicking on an account allows the user to Deposit, Withdraw, and Transfer funds as well as check their Balance.<br>
After completing a transaction the user can request a receipt which is printed to the terminal.
